<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Madhu Sri Akarsh Chitturu, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati with a strong 
  passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. From an early age, I have been drawn to how systems 
  work beneath the surface, which naturally led me to pursue computer science. Currently, I am focused on building a 
  strong foundation in software development, data structures, algorithms, and system design to prepare myself for a dynamic 
  career in the tech industry.</p>

<p>I have actively engaged in both academic and hands-on learning, contributing to real-world projects such as developing a 
  website during my internship at C.V. Ramana School Needs Firm. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills in 
  web development but also taught me the importance of communication, teamwork, and meeting client expectations. I am currently 
  investing time in expanding my knowledge through courses like CS50x and working on personal projects that involve Python, 
  web frameworks, and database management systems.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to secure impactful co-op and internship experiences that will challenge me to grow both technically and 
  professionally. I am committed to becoming a well-rounded engineer who not only writes efficient code but also understands the 
  broader picture â€” from user needs to scalability and ethical implications. With a mindset grounded in curiosity and perseverance, 
  I am constantly pushing myself toward becoming the best version of the professional I aspire to be.</p>
